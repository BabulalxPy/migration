Once you have installed the tool, you can start migrating your data. Hereâ€™s a simple command to get you started:

Before running the migration, you may need to configure some settings. You can do this in the `config.yaml` file. Here are some common settings:

```yaml
qdrant:
  url: "http://localhost:6333"
  api_key: "your_api_key_here"

## Examples

### Migrating a CSV File

To migrate a CSV file, use the following command:

```bash
python migrate.py --source data.csv --destination http://localhost:6333/collections/my_collection --format csv
```

### Migrating a JSON File
